How to export Google Play 512×512 icon (macOS)
1) Ensure you have the project 1024×1024 icon at `app_icons/ios/Icon-App-1024x1024@1x.png` (already in repo).
2) Run:
   ```bash
   cd store_assets/scripts
   bash export_store_assets.sh
   ```
3) The 512×512 icon will be created at `store_assets/google_play/icon-512.png`.

Feature Graphic
- Edit `google_play/feature-graphic-1024x500.svg` if needed (title/subtitle/colors).
- Export it as PNG 1024×500 (Preview → File → Export… → PNG → set size to 1024×500).

App Store
- Use `app_store/app-icon-1024.png` for the App Store Connect app icon. Apple requires 1024×1024.
- Screenshots should be captured from real devices/simulators with proper sizes (iPhone 6.7 1284×2778, 6.5 1242×2688, 5.5 1242×2208, etc.).

Copy
- Use `copy/en.txt` and `copy/zh.txt` texts for the Play Store / App Store descriptions.
